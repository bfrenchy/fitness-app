# Fitness Planning App

## Purpose

This app is designed to help the user get a workout routine using the OpenAI API.

## The App

By running app.py, a tkinter GUI will open and guide the user through a number of questions.

First, the user selects up to three sports.

Then, based on those selections, the application will ask the user three questions for each sport, such as experience level, mobility limitations, and goals.

Once done, the responses are passed to OpenAI to produce a parse-able table.
